# Harmonic Challenges Progression System

Welcome to the **Harmonic Challenges Progression System** repository!  
This project describes a progression system for harmonic challenges, designed to help model and evolve ecosystems through sequential challenge stages and resolutions.

## üìñ System Overview

The system consists of three tiers of challenges:

1. **Foundational Tier Challenges (1‚Äì4)**: Basic challenges.
2. **Intermediate Tier Challenges (5‚Äì8)**: Medium complexity challenges.
3. **Advanced Tier Challenges (9‚Äì12)**: High-level challenges.

Each challenge follows a resolution cycle that includes the following stages:

- **Challenge Emergence**: Generation of challenges based on environmental conditions.
- **Solution Approach**: Selection of a resolution method (entity spawning, environmental adjustment, or a combination).
- **Implementation & Feedback**: Real-time ecosystem response to intervention attempts.
- **Resolution Evaluation**: Assessment of resolution success.

Outcomes can be:
- Successful (reward generation and progression to the next challenge).
- Failed (challenge evolves and becomes more complex).
